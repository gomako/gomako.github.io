          <p class="da3-da6">This is where I learn to use a versioning system that isn't Dropbox, which has worked pretty well for me so far, but the teams I have been part of are pretty small!</p>
          <p class="da3-da6">The sites and apps that I make now I want to look good and give the user the best experience possible in the site they are using.</p>
          <p class="da3-da6">This site was very very heavily influenced by the guys at Gridset, I am really getting into grid systems right now and have them to thank for starting me off!</p>
